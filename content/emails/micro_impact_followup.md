Subject: A quick update on the impact of your support

Dear {{ first_name | default:"Friend" }},

Some time ago, you made a donation to Shield of Athena. We wanted to share a small glimpse of the impact you helped create.

Thanks to supporters like you:

- {{ micro_stat_1 }}  
- {{ micro_stat_2 }}  

Behind each number is a real person taking steps toward safety, healing, and stability. Your contribution is part of that journey.

Thank you for standing with women and children affected by violence.

With appreciation,  
Shield of Athena
